\begin{abstract}
	Give a short description of this report content. 
	
	Take into account that a design document is a complete high-level solution to the problem presented. It should be detailed enough that somebody who already understands the problem could go out and code the project without having to make any significant decisions. Further, if this somebody happens to be an experienced coder, they should be able to use the design document to code the solution in a few hours (not necessarily including debugging).
